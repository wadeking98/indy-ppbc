# indy-ppbc

This repository contains demos built using [django-indy-community](https://github.com/AnonSolutions/django-indy-community).  Please refer to this repository for framework documentation.

The master branch of this repository contains a "bare bones" application incorporating django-indy-community, using the provided UI.  To run this demo:

Open two shells, and in each shell run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/von-network.git
cd von-network
./manage build
./manage start
```

... and in the second shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wadeking98/indy-ppbc.git
# this is necessary only on 'nix since we are mounting local directories
chmod -R a+rwx indy-community-demo/indy_community_demo
cd indy-community-demo/docker
./manage start
```

That's it!  Connect to (http://localhost:8000/) to view the patient portal UI
or connect to (http://localhost:8000/indy/) to view the backend

For more detailed instructions on running the demo, and options on running all services locally, see the [documentation in django-indy-community](https://github.com/AnonSolutions/django-indy-community/tree/master/docker).

For instructions on how to incorporate django-indo-community into your own application, [please see ./docs](./docs)
